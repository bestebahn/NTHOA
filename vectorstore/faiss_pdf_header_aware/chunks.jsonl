{"text": "NACHES TERRACE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION RULES & REGULATIONS EFFECTIVE: September 13, 2004\n\nFOREWORD The underlying philosophy of the Naches Terrace Homeowners Association (NTHOA) Rules and Regulations is COMMUNITY LIVING. Positive communication with your neighbors is the best solution to many problems. The enforcement procedures contained within this document should only be used as a last resort after all attempts have been made by the parties involved to resolve the issue. These Rules and Regulations are a supplement to the Covenants (CC&R\u2019s) of the Naches Terrace Homeowners Association. Your help in seeing that the provisions of this booklet are carried out is welcomed and appreciated. Leaving the enforcement of these rules and regulations to others places an unfair burden on them. All residents must share in this responsibility.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS ARTICLE 1 ASSESSMENTS A. Collection Procedures 4 ARTICLE 2 ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES A. General 5 B. Complaint Procedures 5 C.

Association rules can also limit the use of landscaping materials that are both drought resistant and fire ignition resistant, making it difficult to create fire safe, drought resistant landscapes and establish defensible space. Similar laws also sometimes prohibit private property owners from allowing their grass to go dormant and brown. (2)(a) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to empower private property owners and remove an obstacle to water use efficiency by prohibiting unreasonable homeowner association, common interest ownership association, and condominium association restrictions that limit private property owners' ability to deploy low-water landscaping techniques, while also ensuring private property owners' ability to create fire safe landscapes. (b) It is also the intent of the legislature to encourage the use of landscaping design techniques that meet the highest standards for water efficiency in the design and construction of state-funded buildings.\" [2020 c 9 s 1.] RCW 64.38.057 Governing documents\u2014Drought resistant landscaping, wildfire ignition resistant landscaping.
